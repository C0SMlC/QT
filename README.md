# QT-Development
Learning QT 6

## Defination
Qt is a cross-platform C++ library and a set of tools that allows developers to create applications for desktop, embedded systems, and mobile platforms. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries and tools for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), handling network operations, managing databases, and more. Qt is widely used for developing both open-source and commercial software.

## Getting Started

### Episode 1 and Episode 2
Before getting stareted with QT, head over to https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss and download qt for the operting system 
After setting up QT now clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/C0SMlC/QT-Development.git
```
Now open the QT creator and select the directory where the repo is cloned and now its your turn to cry :))

## Key Points

### Episode 3
The Episode 3 is just basic QT with C++(oh I forgot to mention C++ is required for QT)
lets start with the imports - 
1. #include <QCoreApplication>
   Provides the basic functionality for Qt applications without a graphical user interface (GUI)
2. #include <QTextStream>
   Provides a convenient way to work with input and output streams
other are just normal c++ headers.

So here essentially we are doing basic io operation in QT and CPP way, now here is the key part

Now to enable the input, goto project tab from the left sidebar and you will see build and run menu from there select run and check the settings now mark the run in terminal
first build the code using the hammer icon in the bottom left corner once done run the code and in the bottom of the console you can see several tabs with numbers such as Issues, Search Results, Application Output and so on.
